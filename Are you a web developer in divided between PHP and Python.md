![img](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*YYW-WZaHXWH4cV_w.jpg)

I made this report to make better decisions in my career as a web developer.

I hope this can be useful to other web devs.

This report was compiled in November 2020.

But this can vary a lot depending on seniority level. Here I compiled a medium salary ignoring seniority level.

| Australia   | **$56k**   | $43k |
| Netherlands | **$55k**   | $44k |
| Canada      | **$48k**   | $46k |
| Brazil      | **$10k**   | $7k  |
